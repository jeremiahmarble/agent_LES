# Microsoft Responsible AI (RAI) Principles

Microsoft outlines six core principles to guide the development and deployment of responsible AI. Each principle is designed to ensure AI is used ethically, transparently, and inclusively.

## 1. Fairness  
AI systems should treat all people fairly and avoid impacting similarly situated individuals differently.  
This means identifying and mitigating bias in training data, models, and deployment contexts.

**Examples:**  
- A loan approval AI that adjusts for historical bias against certain zip codes.  
- A hiring algorithm that ensures gender-neutral evaluation of résumés.

---

## 2. Reliability and Safety  
AI systems should perform reliably and safely in all expected conditions.  
They should be tested for robustness and fail gracefully in edge cases.

**Examples:**  
- A self-driving car system that safely navigates during extreme weather.  
- An AI-powered medical diagnostic tool that flags uncertain predictions for human review.

## 3. Privacy and Security  
AI systems must protect personal data and be secure from misuse or attacks.  
They should comply with privacy laws and use techniques like differential privacy where appropriate.

**Examples:**  
- A chatbot that redacts sensitive information from conversation logs.  
- A face recognition system that encrypts user data and limits access.

---

## 4. Inclusiveness  
AI should empower everyone and be usable by people with a wide range of needs and abilities.  
Involving diverse stakeholders in design leads to more equitable outcomes.

**Examples:**  
- A voice assistant that recognizes accents and speech impairments.  
- A vision system that accounts for color blindness in UI design.

---

## 5. Transparency  
People should understand how AI systems work and why they make certain decisions.  
Clear documentation and model explainability are key.

**Examples:**  
- A mortgage risk model that provides human-readable reasons for denial.  
- A recommendation engine that shows users why content was suggested.

---

## 6. Accountability  
People and organizations must be accountable for the AI systems they create and deploy.  
This includes establishing governance, oversight, and redress mechanisms.

**Examples:**  
- An internal AI ethics review board that audits models before deployment.  
- A clear support process for users to dispute or appeal automated decisions.
